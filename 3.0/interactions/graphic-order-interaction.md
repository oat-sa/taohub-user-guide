# Graphic Order Interaction

>The Graphic Order interaction gives Test-takers the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge about chronological order, orders of importance, etc. as seen on a graphic (map, photo, other image).

>All graphic interactions can be found in the Graphic Interactions menu in the Library. All require dragging the appropriate icon, such as the Graphic Order interaction icon, over the blank Item and dropping it on the blue block that appears when the icon is passed over it. This will result in the Resource Manager window appearing to request the test author to select a background graphic. A list of previously uploaded graphics will appear, above which is a blue *Add file(s)* and *browse* buttons to hunt down and add files to the resource manager by clicking the green *Upload* button. If uploading is not necessary, highlight the appropriate background graphic in the resource manager list and click the green *Select* button to move toward the first step of setting up this interaction.

>For the Graphic Order interaction, a new authoring window will appear with the background graphic in the center of the canvas. Above the graphic will be a field for writing in the question associated with this interaction. To the left will be an Associable Hotspot Panel for inserting selected shapes that will represent *Associable Hotspots* into the background graphic (these include four different shapes: rectangle, circle, oval, and polygon). Below the Hotspot Panel will be a trash can icon, which allows the user to delete a poorly-placed or misshaped Hotspot. Below the background graphic is a gap match field for entering in answers (in the form of graphic elements).

**Step 1:** Fill in the question field. 

This should cover such important information as what the background graphic represents, and what the Test-taker is supposed to do in this interaction. Note that the A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and insert a picture.  

**Step 2:** Insert the *Associable Hotspots* onto the background graphic.

To place a rectangle, click on one corner and drag across the intended area the Hotspot is supposed to cover. To place a circle or oval, select its center and drag outward or inward until the Hotspot is at the right size. To place a polygon, begin at one corner, then click on each corner in succession until the Hotspot is completed. All the shapes can be edited, but if necessary, click on the problem Hotspot, then click the trash can to delete it, and then try again. 

After the Hotspots are added in, the minimum and maximum number of choices that a Test-taker can provide will need to be entered in the field located at the bottom of the Properties Panel. A minimum above zero requires that the Test-taker provide an answer to the question before moving off the interaction, while the maximum should be above zero in order that the Test-taker can provide at least one answer to the question.

**Step 3:** Click Response in the header bar to set the hot spots in the order required by the question.

This will bring up the same screen, but it is now possible to associate the numeric order with the hot spots selected.

**Step 4:** Associate the order numbers with the appropriate Hotspot.

To do this, click on the number, then the Hotspot. Repeat until all the numbers are assigned a Hotspot.

**Step 5.** If desired, insert modal feedback into this interaction. You may find this option within the Properties Panel.

For more information on Modal Feedback, [see the *Modal Feedback* section](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**Step 6:** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Graphic Order interaction looks like. For more on previewing, [review its section](../items/preview.md).
