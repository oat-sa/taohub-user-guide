# Extended Text Interaction

>The Extended Text Interaction provides the means of examining the Test-Taker's ability to reproduce a phrase, sentence, or text passage exactly. The answer must not deviate from the original in any way.

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Extended Text Interaction:

**1.** From the [Common Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *Extended Text* icon onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This opens a new Extended Text Interaction window. There is a question field at the top, with an *extended text field* below it. 

**2.** Fill in the question field, where it says 'define prompt'. 

The test-taker will be expected to remember the answer exactly, without any variation. Even an extra space will result in the answer being marked as incorrect. 

*Note: The A icon on the right allows you to bold or italize text, and to insert a picture, [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus), [math expression](../appendix/glossary.md#math-expression) or link into your question.*

##Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following options are available in the [Interaction Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

###Defining a certain format

Plain text format is the default which is expected as input from the test-taker. If desired, you can specify the type of text format as either *[preformatted text](../appendix/glossary.md#preformatted-text)* or *XHTML* in the *Format* box. 

###Placing constraints on the answer

You can limit the length of text the test-taker enters in the answer field by setting a maximum length or word count. Alternatively, you can specify a certain [pattern](../appendix/glossary.md#pattern) in *Constraints*.
 
###Giving hints about the text length

You can provide hints for the test-taker about the length of the text by filling in the *Recommendations* fields.
This provides the test-taker with an expected length, in either characters or number of lines. (This can also be done after you have entered the answered expected in *Step 4*.)

**4.** Click *Response* on the right of blue interaction header to define the correct answer(s).

Enter the expected answer in the answer field. Again, the test-taker is expected to answer exactly. Any variation(s) will result in the answer being marked as incorrect.

##Optional Extras when Processing a Response

The following options are available in the [Response Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#response-properties-panel) on the right.

###Inserting modal feedback

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more information on how to do this, [see the *Modal Feedback* section](../items/modal-feedback.md).

</aside>

**5.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your Extended Text Interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your Interaction using the steps given in the [Preview instructions](../items/preview.md).
