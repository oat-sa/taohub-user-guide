# Interactions: An Overview

>[Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) are the basic building blocks for [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item), which in turn are the basic building blocks for [tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test). For a full definition, see [What is an Interaction?](../interactions/what-is-an-interaction.md).

This section provides an overview of how to manage your interactions, including what you need to do to construct them, what the result looks like, the choices you need to make along the way, and what you can do with them once they have been created.

## Using different kinds of Interactions

There are four categories of Interactions in TAO: simple, text-based, graphic, and miscellaneous.

**Simple Interactions** are also known as [Common Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interaction). Common Interactions cover many of the simple interactions that are commonly used in testing. In TAO, the following Common Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Choice Interaction
- Order Interaction
- Associate Interaction
- Match Interaction
- Hottext Interaction
- Gap Match Interaction
- Slider Interaction
- Extended Text Interaction
- File Upload Interaction

**Text-based Interactions** are also known as [Inline Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interaction). Inline Interactions are interactions which employ contain text-based elements. In TAO, the following Inline Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Inline Choice Interaction
- Text Entry Interaction
- End Attempt Interaction


**[Graphic Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#graphic-interaction)** elements. In TAO, the following Graphic Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Hotspot Interaction
- Order Interaction
- Associate Interaction
- Gap Match Interaction
- Select Point Interaction

**Miscellaneous Interactions** are also known as Portable [Custom Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#custom-interaction) (or PCIs). Portable Custom Interactions are interactions which are developed for a specific scenario, mostly to fulfill a specific need of a customer.

## Creating New Interactions

New Interactions are created as part of Items in a Test. 
With the exception of PCIs (which are project-specific),
each of the above Interactions is described in detail in its own section in the User Guide.
