# Extended Text Interaction

>The Extended Text interaction provides the means of demonstrating the Test-taker's ability to recite exactly a phrase, sentence, or passage. The Test-taker is required to convey exactly an answer that can be of any length. 

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Extended Text* icon onto the blank Item and drop into the blue block.

This opens a new Extended Text interaction window that shows a question field and an *extended text field*. 

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

Bear in mind that the answer should be one that the Test-taker will be expected to remember exactly, without any variation whatsoever. Even an extra space will result in the answer being marked incorrect. Note that the A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and insert a picture.

**Step 3:** Fill in the Recommendations fields in the Properties Panel.

These provide hints to the Test-taker about either the length of the passage in characters, or the number of lines involved with the final answer. (This can actually be done after *Step 4*.)

**Step 4:** Click Response in the interaction header.

Here, the test-author will provide the expected answer. Again, the Test-taker will be expected to answer exactly. Any variation from what is entered here will result in the answer being marked as incorrect.
