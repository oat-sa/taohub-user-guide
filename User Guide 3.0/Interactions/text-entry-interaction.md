# Text Entry Interaction

>Text Entry allows the Test-taker to complete a "fill the blank" question with an exact text answer. This interaction is one of two *Block*-related interactions, the other being *Inline Choice* (covered in its own section). 

In order to begin creating either an *Inline Choice* or *Text Entry* item, it is first necessary to select the Inline Interactions bar, and then drag the *Block* interaction, represented by a letter *A* icon, out of the left-hand Library Panel and into the canvas area, dropping it into the blue text block that will appear. This will create a field in which text may be cut and pasted from a favorite source (a Word document or website, for instance), or typed in. 

The A icon on the right of the block text allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and if useful insert a picture into your block text.

**Step 1:** Once the text is placed, create a Text Entry field by dragging from the Library Panel to a space next to where the Test-taker will be expected to *fill the blank*.

This creates a pop-up window showing the blank to be adjusted. In the default Question mode, no changes can be made to the blank, as the Test-taker is expected to enter in the answer. However, a correct answer will need to be selected and this is done in the Response mode.

**Step 2:** Click Response in the interaction header.

This opens the response entry window, in which you can enter in the correct answer. Note that the test author will need to produce an answer that the Test-taker will be expected to exactly match, character-for-character, including spaces. Repeat steps 1 and 2 until all the desired Text Entry blanks have been inserted into the text.

If desired, modal feedback can be inserted into each individual Text Entry interaction. You may find this option within the Properties Panel while in *Response* mode. For more information on Modal Feedback, [see the *Modal Feedback* section](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**Step 3:** Remove the text that the Text Entry blank is supposed to replace.

This necessary step effectively completes the replacement of text by the Text Entry blank. 

**Step 4:** Click anywhere outside of the Work Space. This will produce in the Properties Panel a check box that can be set if the interaction is to be time dependent (completed within a certain interval) by the Test-taker. Check if this is the case.

Time dependence is useful for limiting the time in which a test-taker has to get through interactions within the examination. [This will be covered in greater detail in Test Settings](../tests/tests-settings.md). 

**Step 5:** Click the blue *Done* button to finish editing.

When this is done, you can preview what your Text Entry item looks like. For more on how to preview, [review its section](../items/preview.md).
