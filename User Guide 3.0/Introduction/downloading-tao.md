# Downloading TAO

>Open Assessment Technologies (OAT) packages TAO, its 100 percent web-based test-making software, in two ways: (1) automatic, and (2) manual. Both are available for download from its website.

Automatic installation is available for Windows users, while manual installation can be done on any computer using any operating system. As long as your machine is connected to the Internet, you are good to go. The only step to this procedure is to click on the appropriate button for your system on the TAO downloads page.

TAO can be downloaded from the [TAO downloads page](http://www.taotesting.com/get-tao/official-tao-packages/). If downloading is not your thing, you can still access all of TAO's features by subscribing to the TAO Cloud(TM). [Check here for more information.](http://www.taotesting.com/support/professional-services/hosting-services-custom-offer-request-form/)

OAT also offers the chance [to take TAO on a test-drive](http://www.taotesting.com/get-tao/take-test-drive/), without downloading or cloud subscription. Check out the look and feel of TAO from a test-taker's perspective, observe how to create test questions using TAO, or observe how easy assessment preparation can be in executing workflows. 

(Login and password for the test-drive are both: demo)
