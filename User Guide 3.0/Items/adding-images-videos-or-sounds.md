# Adding Images, Videos or Sounds

>In earlier versions of TAO, inserting images, videos, and sounds was done through a special feature. This is no longer the case. Videos and sounds are inserted through the Media interaction, while still images are handled in a different way. For instructions on how to insert Media (videos or sound files), refer to the Media interaction section. For still images, this section will review the instructions on inserting these into a typical text block.

**Step 1:** All text blocks have a tab with an icon attached that governs changes to text. The icon is basically a capital letter *A*. Click on this icon.

This displays a menu bar with several icons. The first group changes the lettering of the text block, allowing you to bold the text, italicize it, or put in a subscript or superscript (useful for math formulas). The second and third groups insert elements. The icon that depicts an omega sign inserts special characters (also useful for mathematical formulas), the chain icon at the end of the bar inserts links to web pages, and the middle icon, showing a picture, inserts still images. This latter icon is the one of greatest interest to this tutorial.

**Step 2:** Click on the picture icon.

This opens a window that provides access to the Resource Manager. This window consists of three panels. As with the main window, the left panel is a Library, the Resource Library. The middle panel serves as a list of pictures that are available within the highlighted Class in the Resource Library. The right panel provides a preview and properties. If your picture is already in the Resource Library, click on that picture and skip to Step 4. If it is not, then carry out Step 3.

**Step 3:** To add a new picture from your desktop, click the blue *Add file(s)* button. After that, click the blue *Browse...* button.

This allows you to navigate your computer system and find a desired still image to upload into your TAO system. Once you selected it, and opened it, click on the green *Upload* button to complete the upload. When it is completed, you'll see the preview image of the graphic. You'll be able to select any .jpg, .gif, or .tif, graphic file to upload and display. (Note: .png files do not work, and will have to be converted to an appropriate format before it can be displayed.)

**Step 4:** Click the green *Select* button.

This uploads your still image into the text block. If you begin typing without a return, the text will be centered vertically. If it extends over more than one line, though, it will wrap underneath the image. If long text follows an uploaded image, it's best to put at least one return in before starting to type.
