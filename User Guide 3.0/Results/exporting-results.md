# Exporting Results

>Results Tables may be set up on almost any computer that has access to TAO. However, there will be situations in which posting Results on another system will be useful. The ability to transmit Results Tables becomes essential in just such a situation. Doing this takes only a few easy steps.

**Step 1:** Upon opening *Results* from the Assessment Builder Bar, click on the desired Results Table. 

This will bring up the Test Results associated with a given Delivery. Typically, this should be done only after the submission deadline has passed, so that all the Results can be compiled onto one table.

**Step 2:** Next, find at the bottom of the Results Table the blue button marked *Export Table*. Click this button.

This brings up the names of all Test-takers who are associated with the Results Table. Above the names are three buttons, one of which, *Add Names*, is activated at the start (it reads *Anonymise* and is in red). The other two buttons are in blue at the start, and are designated to *Add All Grades* and *Add All Responses*. The first button controls the display of names associated with the Results Table. The second controls the display of scores. The third controls display of responses given. A filter control sits between these buttons and the table, and this sorts out entries based on the order in which answers (variables) were received.

Below the Results Table is a blue button that allows the user to continue with the export.

**Step 3:** Click the *Export CSV File* button.

This creates a *character separated value* file formatted for Microsoft Excel that can be translated into score information. Once the button is clicked, a window comes up to ask where you would like to save the file. This can be a special folder, the desktop, etc.

**Step 4:** Select the location on which to export your Results, and then *Save*.

The Results Table, easily opened in Excel, will then be available to transfer either by data storage device or over a computer network.
