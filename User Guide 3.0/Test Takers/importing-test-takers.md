# Importing Test-Takers

>Test-taker metadata files can be [taken from any computer](../test-takers/exporting-test-takers.md) and imported onto any other computer that also has access to TAO. This is done through a specific operation called *Import*.

**Step 1:** Upon opening *Test-takers* from the Assessment Builder Bar, click on the Test-taker class (folder) in its library. Within the button bank below the Library, click *Import*.

This opens a pane that asks, among the supported input formats (Question and Test Interoperability or QTI, or Resource Description Framework or RDF), to choose the format of the anticipated incoming Test-taker metadata. Once this is selected, click the blue Browse button to find the file intended for import (alternatively, the file may be dragged and dropped into the pane below the button). 

**Step 2:** Once the Test-taker is selected, hit the blue *Import* button.

This will import the Test-taker into the Test-taker library, after which [the Test-taker can receive Tests](../deliveries/create-a-new-delivery.md).
