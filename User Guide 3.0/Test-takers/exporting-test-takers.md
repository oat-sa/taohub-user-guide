# Exporting Test-Takers

>Test-taker profiles may be assembled on almost any computer that has access to TAO. However, there will be situations in which sharing test-taker profiles will be useful. For instance, a Test-taker may have successfully passed a prerequisite course and is now enrolling in a more advanced study with a different teacher. The ability to share Test-taker profiles becomes convenient in just such a situation. Doing this takes only a few easy steps.

**Step 1:** Upon opening *Test-takers* from the Assessment Builder Bar, either click on an existing test-taker class (folder) in the Test-taker Library panel, or click on the Test-taker folder itself. In the Actions Bar, click New Class. 

Creating a new class, or a new folder, allows the user to place unorganized Groups of Test-takers in an organized location in which they can be made ready to be transferred from one machine to another (for organized class sections, review how to export groups). When doing this, where it says “Edit subject class” in the canvas area, find the field marked *Label*. Here the *ad hoc* Test-taker class can be renamed, if desired.  Hitting the blue *Save* button will create the class.

**Step 2:** In the Test-taker Library, move the Test-takers to be transferred to the class.

This selects the Test-takers that will be exported.

**Step 3:** After clicking on the class select from the button bank below the Library *Export*.

Alternatively, an individual Test-taker can be clicked on for exporting, without creating a new class to transfer it in. However, in most instances it is useful to organize the transfer in a single folder that can be exported in one go.

The pane that comes up on the canvas will ask that you confirm that the folder or Test-taker metadata file highlighted is the one that should be exported as a Resource Description Framework or RDF file. Click the blue *Export* button in the pane to continue with the export.

**Step 4:** Select the location on which to export your Test-taker file, and then save.

The Test-taker metadata will then be available to transfer either by data storage device or over a computer network. The next step in the transfer is [to import the Test-takers onto the desired computer](../test-takers/importing-test-takers.md).
