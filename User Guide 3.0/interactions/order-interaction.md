# Order Interaction

>The Order interaction gives Test-takers the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of a particular order of elements. These can include chronological orders, priority orders, alphabetical or numerical orders, orders of size, etc.

**Step 1:** From the Common Interactions menu in the Library Panel, drag the *Order* icon onto the blank Item and drop the resulting box in the blue field that appears when the interaction is dragged over it.

This creates a new Order Interaction window. There will be a field for placing in a question at the top, and two side-by-side panels, the left of which provides fields for the options to be placed in an appropriate order.

**Step 2:** Fill in the question field. 

This will describe the task given to the Test-taker ("Place the following in chronological order", etc.). Note that the A icon on the right allows you to put your text in bold or in italic for instance, and insert a picture into the question.

**Step 3:** Fill in the options pertaining to the question.

Options may be added by clicking the blue *Add choice* field if three options are not enough. If needed, these may be placed in a particular order, or they may be placed in any order and then shuffled (the latter is usually recommended). To shuffle, click *Shuffle choices* in the Interaction Properties panel.

**Step 4:** Fill in the answers after clicking *Response* in the blue interaction header.

To do this, click on each option in its correct order as requested by the question field.

**Step 5.** If desired, insert modal feedback into this interaction. You may find this option within the Properties Panel.

For more information on Modal Feedback, [see the *Modal Feedback* section](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**Step 6:** Click the blue *Done* button.

When this is done, you can preview what your Order interaction looks like. For more on how to preview, [review its section](../items/preview.md).
