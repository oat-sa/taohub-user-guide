# Create a New Delivery

>[Assembled deliveries](../deliveries/what-is-a-delivery.md) provide the means of publishing and administering tests. These govern when a Test is taken by selected individual or groups of Test-takers and how long Tests will be. A delivery can only be assembled after the creation of interactions, the assembly of the Test, the creation of Test-taker profiles, and the gathering of Test-takers into formal Groups.

Now, let's walk through the steps of creating a Delivery.

**1.** Click on the Deliveries icon in the *[Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar)*. 

This will take you to the Deliveries page, and will show the last Delivery which you, or the user before you, created. On the left-hand side of your screen you will see the [Delivery Library](../appendix/glossary.md#delivery-library) of existing deliveries. The last delivery which was created will be highlighted in the Library. In this tour, however, you will create a new Delivery.

**2.**  Click on the *New delivery* icon in the button bank under the *library*.

This brings up a dialog box entitled *Create a New Delivery*, which asks for a Test selection. From the pull-down menu, select the Test that is to be sent to Test-takers in this delivery. Once selected, click *Publish*. 

A properties panel will come up.

*Note: To create a new delivery in a different folder, select the desired folder in the Library, and then click on the New delivery icon in the button bank. To create a new folder (in TAO these represent new classes), click on New class in the button bank, and then give it a label. Highlight where to put the new folder relating to the new class.*

**3.** Set the delivery properties. 

*Label*: The default name of the delivery is 'Delivery of *Test Name*'. This can be changed as needed. 

*Maximum number of executions*: if left empty, test-takers may take the delivered test an unlimited number of times. Setting this number to any non-zero integer will limit the test-takers to that number of attempts at the Test.

*Start Date* and *End Date*: this establishes the earliest date and time and latest date and time that the test can be taken. Clicking on either date field provides a graphical interface which allows you to set the date and time (using a calendar, and slider controls for hours and minutes). However, it is also possible to provide the date and time by manually typing them in in the following order: year, month, day, and 24-hour clock (YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM)

The *Result Server* allows you to choose where the results should be stored (the default is RDS ResultStorage).

The *Display Order* allows you to specify the order in which the deliveries are presented.

As a test-taker you are presented with a list of all the deliveries which are assigned to you. These are normally unordered unless you set *display order* to a numeric value. This numeric value defines the position of delivery in the *Available* list.

*Access*: If the *Guest Access* box is checked, people who are not registered as test-takers can view the delivery.

**4.** Assign the test to a group of test-takers in the panes on the right of the Properties panel.

The Assigned to pane contains all available groups of Test-takers. Select a Group, and click the blue Save button below. If there are Test-takers in the Group who, for whatever reason, should not take this exam (due to absence, remedial assignments, etc.), click the blue Excluded Test-takers button at the bottom of the Test-takers pane.

The *Assigned to* pane contains all available groups of test-takers. Select a Group, and click the blue *Save* button below. If there are test-takers in the Group who, for whatever reason, should not be taking this exam (because of absence, remedial assignments, etc.), click the blue *Excluded Test-takers* button at the bottom of the test-taker's pane. To move a person from assigned status to excluded status, simply click on that person's name in the *assigned* column. Click *save* to close the pop-up window.
