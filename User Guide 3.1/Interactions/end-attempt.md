# End Attempt

>[End Attempt](../appendix/glossary.md#end-attempt) offers [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) the possibility of exiting from a particular item in a test without completing it.

> The *End Attempt* icon can be found in the [Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#interactions-library) on the left, under [Inline-interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions).


**1.** Including *End Attempt* in your test [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item).
 
The *End attempt* option can be added to a test item by means of an inline interaction inserted into a text block. 

After you have created a new Item, a [text block](../appendix/glossary.md#text-block) is inserted by dragging the *Block* interaction (represented by a letter *A* icon) from the [Inline Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions-library) below *Common Interactions* on the left, onto the blank Item and dropping it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas). This creates a field (containing a sample text).

To insert the *End Attempt* button, drag the *End Attempt* icon (represented by the word *END* and a finish flag) from the [Inline Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions-library) below *Common Interactions* on the left, onto the text field and drop it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

A blue button will appear in the text box, reading *End Attempt*.

A test-taker can click on this button during a test to indicate that he/she wants to give up on that particular item. The test normally then moves on to the next item.
