# Order Interaction

>The Order interaction gives Test-Takers the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of a particular order of elements: chronological orders, priority orders, alphabetical or numerical orders, orders of size, etc.

[![Order Interaction]()](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ocF1RrjKZTI)

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Order Interaction:

**1.** From the [Common Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *Order* icon onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This creates a new Order Interaction window. There is a question field at the top, with two boxes underneath.

**2.** Enter the question in the question field, where it says 'define prompt'.

This will describe the task given to the test-taker ("Place the following in chronological order", etc.). 

*Note: The A icon on the right allows you to bold or italize text, and to insert a picture, [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus), [math expression](../appendix/glossary.md#math-expression) or link into your question.*

**3.** Fill in the options for each question in box to the left.

There are three default options, but you can add more by clicking the blue *Add choice* field at the bottom. You can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the option you wish to delete.

##Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following options are available in the [Interaction Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

###Shuffling the choices

Check the *Shuffle choices* box. This means that the order in which the answer options are presented will be randomized (recommended if the order of presentation is not important).

###Specifying correct number of answers

Specify the minimum and maximum number of answer options that the test-taker will be asked to provide (before he can continue to the next question) in the *Allowed Choices* boxes. By default these are empty, which means the test-taker can include as many (or as few) of the answer options as he likes. (Setting the minimum to 0 allows the test-taker to skip the question.)

###Presenting the answer options in list format

The answer options can be presented as a list. To choose a [list style](../appendix/glossary.md#list-style), select one of the options in *List style*, located below the *Allowed Choices* in the Interaction Properties panel.

###Present the answer options horizontally

Below the *List style* option is the *Orientation* option. Answer options can be presented either vertically or horizontally using this option. The default is vertical.

**4.** Click *Response* on the right of blue interaction header to define the correct answer(s).

Then click on each option in the left-hand box in the desired order. The options will be transferred in this order to the right-hand box. If you are not satisfied with the order you have chosen, click in the right-hand box and then on the option which is in the wrong place. You can then click on the *up* or *down* arrow on the right to move it up or down respectively.

##Optional Extras when Processing a Response

The following option is available in the [Response Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#response-properties-panel) on the right.

###Inserting modal feedback

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more information on how to do this, [see the *Modal Feedback* section](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**6.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your Order Interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your Interaction using the steps given in the [Preview instructions](../items/preview.md).
