# Text Blocks

>[Text Blocks](../appendix/glossary.md#text-block) are used to create [inline interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions). A text block is basically a paragraph, and forms a framework into which one of the two available text-based inline interactions (Inline Choice, Text Entry) is then inserted.

> Text Blocks are represented by the icon **A** *Block* in the [Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#interactions-library) on the left, under [Inline-interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions).

   
**1.** Using Text Blocks in Inline Interactions

After you have created a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), drag the *Block* interaction (represented by a letter *A* icon) from the [Inline Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions-library) below *Common Interactions* on the left, onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This creates a field (containing a sample text) in which a text may be entered from a favorite source (you can copy and paste text from any text editor, or website, for instance), or typed in.

To enter your text, click inside the text field.

*Note: The A icon on the right allows you to bold or italize text, and to insert a picture, [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus), [math expression](../appendix/glossary.md#math-expression) or link into your block text.*

For more detail on how to create the two inline interactions which use *Text Blocks*, see the sections on [Inline Choice Interaction](../interactions/inline-choice-interaction.md) and [Text Entry Interaction](../interactions/text-entry-interaction.md).
