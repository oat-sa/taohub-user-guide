# Downloading TAO

>Open Assessment Technologies (OAT) packages its 100% web-based test-compiling software "TAO" in two forms: (1) automatic, and (2) manual. Both are available for download from its website.

Automatic installation is available for Windows users, while manual installation can be done on any computer using any operating system. 

While connected to the internet, click on the corresponding button for your system on the [TAO download page](http://www.taotesting.com/get-tao/official-tao-packages/). Alternatively, you can access all of TAO's features by subscribing to the [TAO Cloud](http://www.taotesting.com/support/professional-services/hosting-services-custom-offer-request-form/).

Curious to see how TAO works? Take our latest version for a [test drive](http://www.taotesting.com/get-tao/take-test-drive/), without downloading or subscribing to the TAO Cloud, by logging in as follows:

   Login:   demo
