# Items: An Overview

>[Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item) are the basic building blocks for [tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test). For a full definition, see [What is an Item?](../items/what-is-an-item.md).


This section provides an overview of how to manage your items, including what you need to do to construct them, what the result looks like, the choices you need to make along the way, and what you can do with them once they have been created.

**1.** Creating a new Item 

Items first need to be created, before they can be filled with the information to be used in a test. They are then  populated with the desired [interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) and any further material required, before they can be used in assessments. See [Creating a new Item](../items/creating-a-new-item.md) for information on how to do this.

**2.** What to include in your Item

Pictures and media such as audio or video files can be included in your Item. For more information on how to do this, see [Adding Images](../items/adding-media.md), for adding to your items, and [Media Interactions](../interactions/media-interaction.md) for adding audio and video files.

For managing resources which are included in your items (which includes all of the resources mentioned above), see the [Media Manager](../items/media-manager.md) section.


**3.** Making decisions about your Item

There are some decisions you will need to take during the process of creating your item. These involve the following:

How do you want your item to appear? For stylistic decisions, see the [Style Editor](../items/style-editor.md)

Will the test-taker receive feedback during the test? See [Modal feedback](../items/modal-feedback.md)

How will the Item be scored? There are various possibilities here: see [Item scoring rules](../items/item-scoring-rules.md)
 
**4.** Previewing your Items

Before finalizing your Item, it is a good idea to preview it. For more information on how to do this, see:
[Preview](../items/preview.md)

**5.** Importing and Exporting about your Items

You can import and export your Items to and from different storage devices. For more information on how to do this, see [Importing Items](../items/importing-items.md) and [Exporting Items](../items/exporting-items.md).
