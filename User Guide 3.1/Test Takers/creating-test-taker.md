# Creating a Test-Taker

>Test-Takers are individuals who will take assessments assembled by TAO. These are typically registered students in a given class, but Test-Takers can be placeholder profiles for an instructor or test administrator to trial a Test.

Now, let's walk through the steps of creating a Test-Taker.

**1.** Click on the Test-Takers icon in the *[Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar)*.

This will take you to the Test-Takers page, and will show the last Test-Taker profile which you, or the user before you, created. On the left-hand side of your screen you will see the [Test-taker Library](../appendix/glossary.md#testtaker-library) of existing test-takers. The last test-taker which was created will be highlighted in the Library. In this tour, however, you will create a new Test-Taker.

**2.**  Click on the *New test-taker* icon in the button bank under the *library* to create a new Test-Taker profile.

This brings up a dialog box entitled *Edit Test-taker*. Enter the personal details of the new Test-Taker, give them a login (which must be unique) and a password, and select an *Interface language* from the pull-down menu.

Enter a profile name for the Test-Taker in the *Label* field. This can be any form of useful identifier (it can, but does not have to be, the Test-Taker's name). An address may be entered in the *Mail* field, for communication with the Test-Taker.

When you have filled these fields, click the blue *Save* button.

*Note: To create a new test-taker profile in a different folder, select the desired folder in the Library, and then click on the New Test-Taker icon in the button bank. To create a new folder (in TAO these represent new classes), click on New class in the button bank, and then give it a label. Highlight where to put the new folder relating to the new class.*


**3.** Place the Test-Taker in a [Group](../appendix/glossary.md#group)

This can also be done from within the [Groups section](../groups/creating-a-new-group.md), but for convenience, it is possible to select an existing group in the *Add to group* pane on the right, and associate the Test-Taker with that group by checking the box next to the desired group. Click the blue *Save* button at the bottom of the pane to complete the procedure.
