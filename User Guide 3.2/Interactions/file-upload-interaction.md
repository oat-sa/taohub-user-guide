# File Upload Interaction

>The File Upload Interaction provides an interface in which Test-Takers can upload a pre-written essay, completed artwork, or other form of submission.

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new File Upload Interaction.

**1.** From the [Common Interactions library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *File Upload* icon onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This opens a new File Upload Interaction window. There is a question/prompt field at the top, and a *Browse* box with which to upload the desired submission.

**2.** Fill in the question field, where it says 'define prompt'. 

Add an instruction for the test-taker to submit work, such as *Upload document*.

*Note: The A icon on the right allows you to bold or italize text, and to insert a picture, [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus), [math expression](../appendix/glossary.md#math-expression) or link into your question.*  

**3.** Select the file type expected.

This can be done in the [Interaction Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right by setting the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type desired for the submission, if applicable.

If a MIME type is selected, this will allow the candidate to submit files of that particular type (*.pdf, .doc, .jpg,* etc.)

**4.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your File Upload Interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your Interaction using the steps given in the [Preview instructions](../items/preview.md).
