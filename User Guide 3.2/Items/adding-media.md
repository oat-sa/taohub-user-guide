# Adding Media

>In earlier versions of TAO, images, videos, and sounds were inserted through a special feature. This is no longer the case. For instructions on how to add Media (videos or sound files), refer to the Media interaction section. For still images, this section will review the instructions on adding these to a typical text block.

**1.** All text blocks in your interaction or item (e.g. the choices in a choice interaction) have a tab with an icon attached that governs changes to text. The icon is a capital letter *A*. Click on this icon.

This displays a menu bar with several icons. The left-hand group changes the lettering of the text block, allowing you to put the text in bold or italics, underline it, or to insert a subscript or superscript (useful for math formulas). The middle and right-hand groups both insert elements. The right-hand group contains a chain icon, which inserts links to web pages. 

In the middle group there are three icons. The first icon, which depicts an omega sign, inserts special characters (also useful for mathematical formulas). You can insert a [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus) using the second icon. The third icon, showing a picture, inserts still images. This tutorial will center around this picture icon.

**2.** Click on the picture icon.

This opens a window which provides access to the [Resource Manager](../appendix/glossary.md#resource-manager), and consists of three panels. As with the main window, the left panel is a Library: the Resource Library. The middle panel shows the list of pictures which are available within the highlighted [Class](../appendix/glossary.md#class) in the Resource Library. The right panel provides a preview and properties. If your picture is already in the Resource Library, click on that picture and skip to Step 4. If it is not, then carry out Step 3.

**3.** To add a new picture from your desktop, click the blue *Add file(s)* button. Then, click the blue *Browse...* button.

You can now navigate your computer system to select the still image you wish to upload into your TAO system. Then click on the green *Upload* button. When it has been uploaded, a preview image of the graphic will appear. You can select any .jpg, .gif, or .tif, graphic file to upload and display. 

*Note: .png files must be converted to an appropriate format before they can be displayed.*

**4.** Click the green *Select* button.

This uploads your still image into the text block. If you begin typing without hitting Return, the text will center vertically. If your text extends beyond the first line, however, it will wrap underneath the image. If the image is followed by a longer text, it is best to hit Return on your keyboard at least once before starting to type.
