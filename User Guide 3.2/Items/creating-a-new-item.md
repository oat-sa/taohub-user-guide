# Creating a New Item

>Together, questions and other types of [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) form [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item), which comprise parts of [Tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test). Items are created and populated with Interactions, and can be combined to assess Test-taker performance.

>There are more than 17 types of interaction in TAO. For information on the types of Interaction available, see the Interactions section. Note that an Item generally contains only one Interaction type.

The videos below will demonstrate how to easily create some of the most popular items using TAO.

How to create a Choice (multiple-choice) Item using TAO:

Now, let's walk through the steps of creating an Item.

**1.**  Click on the Items icon in the *[Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar)*.

This will take you to the Items page. The [Library](../appendix/glossary.md#library) on the left-hand side will show existing Items. The last Item to be edited (either by you or a previous user) will be highlighted in the Library. In this tour, however, you will create a new Item.

**2.**  Click on the *New item* icon in the button bank under the *library*.

This will create a new item in the selected folder. 

*Note: To create a new item in a different folder, click on that folder in the Library, and then select the New item icon in the button bank. To create a new folder (in TAO these represent classes), click on New class in the button bank. Select a location within the Library, and the new folder (class) will be created there.*

**3.**  Label and save your Item.

Creating a new Item will bring up a new dialog box with the option to name (or label) your item. After labeling your item, click *Save*. This produces an empty item, which you can now populate with interactions.

**4.**  Click on the option *Authoring* in the *[Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar)*.

This will take you to the empty Item you have created. You can now start to fill this with your interactions. In the Library on the left, you will now see the *[Common Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions)* catalog. You will find the other types of interaction below this catalog: *[Inline Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interactions)*, *[Graphic Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#graphic-interactions)* and *[Custom Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#custom-interactions)*. You can navigate these catalogs to choose the types of interaction you want to use for your item. The Interaction section will tell you about the different types of interaction which you can use in TAO.

*Note: Items are 'locked' when you (or another user) are working on them.*

##Optional Extras


###Duplicating an already existing Item

You can make a copy of an already existing item by clicking on the *Duplicate* icon in the button bank under the *library*. A duplicate will then be created in the folder of the item you have duplicated, with the same name but with "bis" on the end.

###Translating your Item

You can translate an existing item by clicking on the *Translate* icon in the Action Bar. This will bring up a dialog box in which select the translation information. Select a language from the drop-down menu, and then label your translated Item in the *Translate Label* box.

###Granting user access

As an administrator, you can permit a user certain access rights to specific folders (classes), items or tests. To do this, select a folder and then click on the *Access Control* icon in the button bank under the *library*.  

This will bring up a window with the following:

- A search bar for users, with a list of users with granted access
- A search bar for roles, with a list of roles with granted access

You can define the rights of every user or role by checking the relevant boxes below:

- *Read* - allows the user to view the folder/item/test
- *Write* - allows the user to edit the folder/item/test, or to create new ones in that folder
- *Grant* - allows both of the above
 
Clicking the brown button *Remove* will delete user/role from the list. 

*Note: Unchecking all the boxes for a specific user/role will also remove them from the list.*
 
When you have checked the correct boxes, click the blue *Save* button to save your changes.

###Viewing the history of an Item

In TAO, it is possible to maintain different versions of the same item, and this is done using the *History* icon.

When you have finished editing an Item, and want to save it as a new version (instead of overwriting the original version), click on *History* in the Action Bar. Before saving the new version, you will need to enter a comment, such as "modified after spring 2016 field test", in order to distinguish it from other versions, and then click *Commit*.

You will then be presented with the history of that Item: the version ID, the date it was saved, the user who authored it, and the comment.

*Note: If any changes are later made to the Item, you can return to the previous version by clicking *Restore*. A new version of the file is then created, and given a correspondingly numbered the default name such as "restored version 1". The file name can be changed.*
