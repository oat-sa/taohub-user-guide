# Test-taker Tools

> The Test-taker Tools comprise a set of tools designed to aid the Test-taker in various ways when taking tests. Many of them are accommodation tools which aim to improve accessibility. The Test-taker Tools for a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test) can be found in the [Properties panel](../appendix/glossary.md#properties-panel) on the right.


To configure the Test-taker Tools for a specific test, follow the steps below.

**1.** Select the test for which the Test-taker Tools are to be configured from the [Test Library](../appendix/glossary.md#test-library) on the left, and click on *Authoring*.

Test-taker Tools can be configured either for a whole section of a test, or on a per-item basis. To configure the Tools for a whole section, on the [canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas) click on the cog wheels to the right of the section in question. To configure the Tools for an individual item, click on the cog wheels to the right of the item in question.

In each case, the Test-taker Tools will appear in the Properties panel on the right.
