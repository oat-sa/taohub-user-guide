# Background Tasks

> In the Premium Edition of TAO, tasks which take a little longer are placed in the background so that you can continue working in other areas instead of having to wait for the first process to finish. This allows users of TAO to multitask.


If you are using the Premium Edition of TAO, this functionality is configured by default so there's no need to do anything. In the Community Edition it is not activated by default, but you can install an extension to activate it if you wish.

If a task is transferred to the background, you will see the process being transported visually up to a task queue on the [Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar), where the number of tasks which are running in the background is shown in a circle to the left of the [Properties](../appendix/glossary.md#properties) icon. If the circle is being orbited, this means there is a process still running in the background.

<!-- Missing Screenshot: Multitasking -->  

Click on the circle to see what background tasks are running, and if any of your background tasks have finished.  A list will open, containing information about each one. Information about background tasks which have finished will remain in this list until you delete it.
