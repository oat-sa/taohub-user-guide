#Item and Test Versioning

> In TAO, it is possible to maintain different versions of the same [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item) or [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).

If you want to save a new version of an item or test (instead of overwriting the original version), the following steps must be carried out.


Click on *History* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar) when you have finished editing the item or test.

A new pane will open in the middle of your screen. 

Enter a comment in the *Message* box, such as "modified after spring 2018 field test". This will distinguish it from other versions. 

Next, click *Commit*.

You will then be presented with the history of the item or test: the version ID, the date it was saved, the user who authored it, and the comment.

*Note: If any changes are later made to the item or test, you can return to the previous version by clicking *Restore*. A new version of the file is then created, and given a default name with a corresponding number such as "restored version 1". The file name can be changed.*
