# Resource Identifiers

> All resources created in TAO - whether they are [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item), [Tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test) or [Deliveries](../appendix/glossary.md#delivery), [Test Centers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-center), [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) or [Groups](../appendix/glossary.md#group) of test-takers - are allocated a unique resource identifier.



Follow the steps below to copy a resource in TAO into an external API. The steps describe how to re-use an item, but they apply to any copiable resource.

**1.** Open the item you would like to copy.

Click on *Items* on the [Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar).

This will take you to the Item [Library](../appendix/glossary.md#library), which you will see on the left.

Next, click on the item in the library which you wish to copy. This opens a dialog box on the canvas in the middle of your screen.

The box labeled *Resource Identifier* gives the URL pertaining to that particular resource.


**2.** Copy the resource into an external API.

To the right of the URL is a picture of a clipboard. Click on this, and the resource identifier will be copied to the clipboard.

The resource can then be pasted into and used in external APIs, for example to retrieve [Results](../appendix/glossary.md#results) using the QTI Results API. Click on the following link for more information about the Results API:
