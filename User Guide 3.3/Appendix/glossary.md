## Action Bar
The menu, in the form of a blue bar, situated under the black Assessment Builder Bar, which appears across the top of all TAO web pages.

<!--
## Adaptive Item
An [Item](../items/what-is-an-item.md) which changes either its Interaction, its scoring, or both, following unsatisfactory attempts by the Test-taker to provide a correct response. Adaptivity is usually used to adapt assessment questions to learning experiences for the candidate, guiding him or her through the Item while scoring performance. Advanced.
-->

## Adaptive Test
A Test which changes the presentation of [Items](../items/what-is-an-item.md) based on Test-taker response. Generally achieved through the use of pre-conditions and branching. Advanced.

## Assessment Builder Bar
The menu, in the form of a black bar, across the top of all TAO web pages.

## Assessment Variable
Technical term for the final score assigned to a Test-taker's performance in an [Item](../items/what-is-an-item.md) Session or a [Test](../tests/what-is-a-test.md) Session.

## Associable Hotspot Panel
The panel on the left of the Hotspot Interaction which is being edited, from which the shapes needed for the hotspots can be chosen.

## Attempt
A single candidate interaction with an [Item](../items/what-is-an-item.md) that possibly assigns values to or updates an associated Response Variable.

## Author
A person who authors material for use in TAO assessments in TAO, typically a teacher. See [Item Author](../appendix/glossary.md#item-author) and [Test Author](../appendix/glossary.md#test-author).

## Authoring System
A system used by authors to create and edit [Items](../items/what-is-an-item.md) and [Tests](../tests/what-is-a-test.md). [TAO](../introduction/take-a-tour.md) is an example of an authoring system.

## Back office
