# Deliveries: An Overview


>[Deliveries](../appendix/glossary.md#delivery) provide the means of publishing and administering [Tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test). These govern when a test is taken, by whom, and how long it is. 

This section provides an overview of how to manage your deliveries, including what you need to do to construct them, and what to do with them afterwards.

**1.** Creating a new Delivery

A delivery is a published test. In practice, publishing a test - i.e. creating a delivery - involves assembling all of the information required to assign and send out a particular test to selected [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker). This includes such information as the test which is to be delivered, the group of test-takers to receive the test, and the circumstances (in particular the time frame) in which the test may be taken. See the [Tests section](../tests/what-is-a-test.md) for more details on what a test is before it is assembled as a delivery.

A delivery can only be assembled after [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item) have been created and populated and compiled in a test. Profiles of the [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) also need to be created and then gathered into [Groups](../appendix/glossary.md#group).

A new delivery can then be put together: see [Creating a new Delivery](../deliveries/create-a-new-delivery.md) for information on how to do this.

**2.** Using your delivery with test-takers

Once your delivery is assembled, the groups of test-takers identified are able to sit the assessment you have prepared within the defined scenario. The [Results](../appendix/glossary.md#results) can then be collected for the whole delivery. For details on how to view the results of your delivery, see the section on [Viewing Results](../results/viewing-results.md).
