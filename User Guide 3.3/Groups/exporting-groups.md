# Exporting Groups

>Formal [Groups](../appendix/glossary.md#group) of [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker), such as laboratory or lecture groups, may be assembled on almost any computer that has access to TAO. However, there will be situations in which sharing the metadata of formal test-taker groups will be useful. For instance, an instructor may need to transfer metadata for an entire class to a substitute or replacement teacher during an absence. Test-taker groups can be shared in a few easy steps.

**1.**  Click on the Groups icon in the [Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar).

**2.**  Click on either the Group folder (class) you want to export in the [Group Library](../appendix/glossary.md#group-library) on the left-hand side, OR click on *New class* in the button bank below the Library to create a new folder for the test-taker group you would like to export.

Creating a new class (i.e. a new folder) allows you to place groups in a distinct location in order to be transferred from one computer to another. When doing this, the group class can be renamed in the *Edit class group* dialog box in the field marked *Label*. Clicking the blue *Save* button will create the class.

*Note: An individual group can be exported without creating a new class to transfer it to. It may be helpful, however, to organize the entire export from a single folder.*

**3.**  If you have created a new class for this purpose, move the group which you want to transfer to this new class in the group library.

This selects the group which is to be exported.

**4.**  After clicking on the class, click *Export* in the button bank below the library.

In the dialog box, confirm that the folder or group metadata file highlighted is the one that should be exported as a Resource Description Framework (RDF) file.

**5.**  Click the blue *Export* button in the dialog box to continue with the export.

**6.**  Select the location to which you want to export your group file, and then click *Save*.

The group metadata can then be transferred either to a data storage device or a computer network. The next step in the transfer is to [import the group file](../groups/importing-groups.md) onto the desired computer.
