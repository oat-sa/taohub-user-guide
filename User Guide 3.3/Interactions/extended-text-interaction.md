# Extended Text Interaction

> The Extended Text [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) provides the means of examining the [Test-taker's](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) ability to reproduce a phrase, sentence, or text passage exactly. The answer must not deviate from the original in any way.

>Usually, these [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item) are scored manually by a human scorer. In TAO 3.2, authors can define outcome variables on the item level for scoring rubrics, for example for grammar, spelling, and contents.

Once you have generated a new item, and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Extended Text Interaction:

**1.** From the [Common Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *Extended Text* icon ![Extended Text](../resourse/_icons/extended-text.png) onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This opens a new Extended Text Interaction window. There is a question field at the top, with an *extended text field* below it. 

**2.** Fill in the question field, where it says _define prompt_. 

The test-taker will be expected to remember the answer exactly, without any variation. Even an extra space will result in the answer being marked as incorrect. 

*Note: See the section on [Interaction Authoring Tools](../interactions/interaction-authoring-tools.md) for details on text editing options such as using italics or bold text in your item, and inserting features such as shared stimuli or media, tables or formulae.*

## Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following options are available in the [Interaction Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

### Defining a certain format

Plain text format is the default which is expected as input from the test-taker. If desired, you can specify the type of text format as either *[preformatted text](../appendix/glossary.md#preformatted-text)* or *XHTML* in the *Format* box. 

### Placing constraints on the answer

You can limit the length of text the test-taker enters in the answer field by setting a maximum length or word count. Alternatively, you can specify a certain [pattern](../appendix/glossary.md#pattern) in *Constraints*.
 
### Giving hints about the text length

You can provide hints for the test-taker about the length of the text by filling in the *Recommendations* fields.
This provides the test-taker with an expected length, in either characters or number of lines. (This can also be done after you have entered the answered expected in *Step 4*.)
</aside>

**4.** Click *Response* on the right of blue interaction header to define the correct answer(s).

Enter the expected answer in the answer field. Again, the test-taker is expected to answer exactly. Any variation(s) will result in the answer being marked as incorrect.

## Optional Extras when Processing a Response

The following options are available in the [Response Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#response-properties-panel) on the right.

### Inserting modal feedback

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more information on how to do this, see the [section on Modal Feedback](../items/modal-feedback.md).

</aside>

**5.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your extended text interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your interaction using the steps given in the [Preview Instructions](../items/preview.md).
