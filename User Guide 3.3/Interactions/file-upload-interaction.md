# File Upload Interaction

>The File Upload [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) provides an interface in which [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) can upload a pre-written essay, completed artwork, or other form of submission. Usually, these items are scored manually by a human scorer.

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new File Upload Interaction.

**1.** From the [Common Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *File Upload* icon ![File Upload](../resourse/_icons/file-upload.png) onto the blank item and drop it onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This opens a new File Upload Interaction window. There is a question/prompt field at the top, and a *Browse* box with which to upload the desired submission.

**2.** Fill in the question field, where it says _define prompt_. 

Add an instruction for the test-taker to submit work, such as *Upload document*.

*Note: See the section on [Interaction Authoring Tools](../interactions/interaction-authoring-tools.md) for details on text editing options such as using italics or bold text in your item, and inserting features such as shared stimuli or media, tables or formulae.* 

**3.** Select the file type expected.

This can be done in the [Interaction Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right by setting the Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) type desired for the submission, if applicable.

If a MIME type is selected, this will allow the candidate to submit files of that particular type (*.pdf, .doc, .jpg,* etc.)

**4.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your file upload interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your interaction using the steps given in the [Preview Instructions](../items/preview.md).
