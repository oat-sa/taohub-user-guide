# Hottext Interaction

>The Hottext [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) gives [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge by showing, among several selections within a body of text, a specific type of word or phrase (e.g. a grammatically incorrect element, misspelling, main character in a story, capital city).

[![Hottext Interaction](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BcG-vjaRuok/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=BcG-vjaRuok&rel=0 "Hottext Interaction")

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Hottext interaction:

**1.** From the [Common Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *Hottext* icon ![Hot Text](../resources/_icons/hottext.png) onto the blank Item and drop it onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This creates a new Hottext Interaction window. There is a question field at the top, followed by a space (containing a sample text) in which to place the text containing the phrases to be highlighted as Hottext elements.

**2.** Fill in the question field, where it says _define prompt_.

This will describe the task given to the test-taker ("Find the mistakes", "Pick the capital city", etc.). 

*Note: See the section on [Interaction Authoring Tools](../interactions/interaction-authoring-tools.md) for details on text editing options such as using italics or bold text in your item, and inserting features such as shared stimuli or media, tables or formulae.*

**3.** Copy and paste, or type in, the text which will contain the Hottexts. 

The test-taker will choose the best option or options from the Hottext elements which answer the question.

**4.** Select a word or phrase and highlight it. When the *magic wand* button comes up, click it to confirm selection of the word or phrase as your Hottext Interaction.

This will create a Hottext element within the text. Typically, there will be one word or phrase that matches the responsee being sought, and several additional words or phrases that might be similar to the response being sought. There might be cases where more than one option is correct, or where none of the options are correct. At the end of the text, you can add a final Hottext element which allows the test-taker to state that there is no correct selection (e.g. "No error.")

## Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following option is available in the [Interaction Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

### Specifying the correct number of answers 

You can specify the minimum and maximum number of Hottext choices the Test-taker will be asked to provide (before he can continue to the next question) in the Allowed Choices boxes. By default these are empty, which means the test-taker can include as many (or as few) answer options as he likes. Setting the minimum to 0 allows the test-taker to skip the question.

**5.** Click *Response* on the right of blue interaction header to define the correct answer(s).

This will produce the same window as before, but you now have the possibility of placing checkmarks by the right answer(s). Check all that apply.

## Optional Extras when Processing a Response

The following options are available in the [Response Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#response-properties-panel) on the right.

### Modifying the scoring method

By default, a test-taker receives one point per completely correct interaction, so in the case of Hottext interactions, the test-taker has to select all the correct Hottext elements in order for the answer to be considered correct.

You may want to modify the scoring system if, for example, you want the test-taker to receive partial credit for selecting some, but not all, of the correct Hottext elements. Or you may wish to give a higher weight to some of the Hottext elements than to others. 

You can do this using the *map response* option of *Response processing*, in the Response Properties panel on the right. When you choose this option, there are several settings you need to enter. 

First, assign a weight for each Hottext element in the boxes next to each one. 

[Click here](../items/item-scoring-rules.md#item-scoring-rules) for more details on how to use this scoring method, and how to set the values of the associated properties.

### Inserting modal feedback 

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more information on how to do this, see the [section on Modal Feedback](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**6.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your Hottext interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your interaction using the steps given in the [Preview Instructions](../items/preview.md).
