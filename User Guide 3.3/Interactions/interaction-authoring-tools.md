# Interaction Authoring Tools

>A [Text Editing Toolbar](../appendix/glossary.md#text-editing-toolbar) is available to the [Item Author](../appendix/glossary.md#item-author), containing various tools for creating new [Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction).

The text editing toolbar appears only when authoring a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item).

It will appear below the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar) once you have created a blank item, clicked on *Authoring*, and then dragged and dropped the interaction template of your choice from the [Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#interactions-library) on the left onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas) in the middle. *Note: See the section [Creating a new Item](../items/creating-a-new-item.md) for details on how to create an item.*
  
The toolbar contains two types of aids:

**Style Features:**

The icons towards the left of the bar can be used to make the text of the item bold, change it to italics, or underline it. You can also include the text as a subscript or a superscript here.

**Feature Insertion:**

Using the icons towards the right, you can insert a special character, a [shared stimulus](../appendix/glossary.md#shared-stimulus), a math expression or formula (using the [formula editor](../appendix/glossary.md#formula-editor)), an image or other type of media, a table, a tooltip, or a link into your question.

Most of these functions work in the same way as in a typical text editor. The tooltip can be used to add explanations for the [Test-taker](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) to specific text fragments of the [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).
