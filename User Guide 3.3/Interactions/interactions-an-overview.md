# Interactions: An Overview

>[Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) are the basic building blocks for [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item), which in turn are the basic building blocks for [Tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test). For a full definition, see [What is an Interaction?](../interactions/what-is-an-interaction.md).

This section provides an overview of how to manage your interactions, including their creation, what to put in an interaction, viewing them, and their use once created.

## Using different kinds of interactions

There are four categories of interactions in TAO: simple, text-based, graphic, and miscellaneous.

**Simple Interactions** are also known as [Common Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interaction). Common Interactions cover many of the simple interactions that are commonly used in testing. In TAO, the following Common Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Choice Interaction
- Order Interaction
- Associate Interaction
- Match Interaction
- Hottext Interaction
- Gap Match Interaction
- Slider Interaction
- Extended Text Interaction
- File Upload Interaction

**Text-based Interactions** are also known as [Inline Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#inline-interaction). Inline Interactions are interactions which contain text-based elements. In TAO, the following Inline Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Inline Choice Interaction
- Text Entry Interaction
- End Attempt Interaction

**[Graphic Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#graphic-interaction)** elements. In TAO, the following Graphic Interactions can be used in the creation of test items:

- Hotspot Interaction
- Order Interaction
- Associate Interaction
- Gap Match Interaction
- Select Point Interaction

**Miscellaneous Interactions** are also known as Portable [Custom Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#custom-interaction) (or PCIs). Portable Custom Interactions are interactions which are developed for a specific scenario, mostly to fulfill a specific need of a customer.

## Creating New Interactions

New interactions are created as part of items in a test. With the exception of PCIs (which are project-specific),
each of the above interactions is described in detail in its own section of the User Guide.
