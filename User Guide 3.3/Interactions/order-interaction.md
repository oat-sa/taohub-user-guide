# Order Interaction

>The Order [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) gives [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge of a particular order of elements: chronological orders, priority orders, alphabetical or numerical orders, orders of size, etc.

[![Order Interaction](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ocF1RrjKZTI/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=ocF1RrjKZTI&rel=0 "Order Interaction")

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Order interaction:

**1.** From the [Common Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#common-interactions-library) on the left, drag the *Order* icon onto the blank item and drop it onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

This creates a new Order Interaction window. There is a question field at the top, with two boxes underneath.

**2.** Enter the question in the question field, where it says _define prompt_.

This will describe the task given to the test-taker ("Place the following in chronological order", etc.). 

*Note: See the section on [Interaction Authoring Tools](../interactions/interaction-authoring-tools.md) for details on text editing options such as using italics or bold text in your item, and inserting features such as shared stimuli or media, tables or formulae.*

**3.** Fill in the options for each question in box to the left.

There are three default options, but you can add more by clicking the blue *Add choice* field at the bottom. You can delete options by clicking the trash can icon to the right of the option you wish to delete.

*Note: Drag-and-drop is enabled for this type of interaction.*

## Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following options are available in the [Interaction Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

### Shuffling the choices

Check the *Shuffle choices* box. This means that the order in which the answer options are presented will be randomized (recommended if the order of presentation is not important).

### Specifying correct number of answers

Specify the minimum and maximum number of answer options that the test-taker will be asked to provide (before he can continue to the next question) in the *Allowed Choices* boxes. By default these are empty, which means the test-taker can include as many (or as few) of the answer options as he likes. (Setting the minimum to 0 allows the test-taker to skip the question.)

### Presenting the answer options in list format

The answer options can be presented as a list. To choose a [List Style](../appendix/glossary.md#list-style), select one of the options in *List style*, located below the *Allowed Choices* in the Interaction Properties panel.

### Present the answer options horizontally

Below the *List style* option is the *Orientation* option. Answer options can be presented either vertically or horizontally using this option. The default is vertical.

**4.** Click *Response* on the right of blue interaction header to define the correct answer(s).

Then click on each option in the left-hand box in the desired order. The options will be transferred in this order to the right-hand box. If you are not satisfied with the order you have chosen, click in the right-hand box and then on the option which is in the wrong place. You can then click on the *up* or *down* arrow on the right to move it up or down respectively.

## Optional Extras when Processing a Response

### Inserting modal feedback

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more information on how to do this, see the [section on Modal Feedback](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**6.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your order interaction is now complete.

After this step, you can preview your Interaction using the steps given in the [Preview Instructions](../items/preview.md).
