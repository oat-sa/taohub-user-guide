# About The Guide

>The TAO User Guide is designed to aid in the use of TAO for the creation and delivery of assessments.

The TAO User Guide focuses on the creation of tests and deliveries of tests, and provides information on the components you will need to deliver a test, such as test items and test-takers. The guide will walk you through the whole process of delivering assessments in TAO, from creating your first item through to retrieving your results.

More advanced topics such as LTI Applications and Metadata are also included along with features available in O.A.T.'s Premium/Ignite Edition of TAO.
