# Importing Items

>If both computers have access to TAO, [Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item) and [interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) can be imported from one computer to another, using an operation called *Import*.

**1.**  Click on *Items* on the *[Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar)*.

This will take you to the Item [Library](../appendix/glossary.md#library), which you will see on the left.

**2.**  Click on the Item class (folder) in the Library in which you wish to import the new item.

**3.**  Click on *Import* in the button bank below the Library.

This opens a dialog box which asks you to select the format of the Item to be imported. The supported input formats are: QTI (Question and Test Interoperability) packages or items, APIP (Accessible Portable Item Protocol) packages, RDF (Resource Description Framework) or CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files. Be sure that the Item to be imported is in this format, or the import won't work.

**4.** Click the blue *Browse* button to find the file intended for import (alternatively, the file may be dragged and dropped into the box below the button).

**5.**  Once the Item is selected, click on the blue *Import* button.

This will import the Item into the Item library, after which it can be added to Tests, or modified.
