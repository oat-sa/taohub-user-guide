# What is an Item?

*"An item is a set of interactions (possibly empty) collected together with any supporting material and an optional set of rules for converting the candidate's response(s) into assessment outcomes."* - [Question and Test Interoperability standard, published by IMS Global](https://www.imsglobal.org/question/index.html).

[Items](../appendix/glossary.md#item) are the basic building blocks for [Tests](../tests/what-is-a-test.md). They may contain a single [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) (a simple item), or several closely-related interactions, all the same type or of a mixture of types (a composite item). Note that items contain interactions, but are not interactions themselves. (See the [Interactions section](../interactions/what-is-an-interaction.md) for a definition of interactions.)

Beyond the interactions contained within them, items  may include titles, images, and text, which help the [Test-taker](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) understand the expectations and context of the assessment material presented within. Item complexity ranges from simple items with a single interaction to composite items with multiple interactions.

*Note: Items are locked when other users are working on them.*
