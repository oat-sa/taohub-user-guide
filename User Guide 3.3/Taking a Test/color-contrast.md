# Color Contrast

>[Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) can select a color scheme for a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).


Test-takers can choose the color scheme for their test by clicking on the *Contrast* menu which appears at the bottom of the screen after they have begun the test, and selecting one of the options. The default setting is a white background.
