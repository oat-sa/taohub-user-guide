# Connection Indicator

>The connection indicator shows connectivity to the internet.
>
>

When a [Test taker](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) begins a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test), a connection indicator in the form of a connectivity icon will appear on the left-hand side of the blue bar across the top. 

Test-takers can check connectivity by hovering over it: if their computer is connected to the internet, the message *Connected to Server* will appear.
