# Hide Time Limits

>A timer shows the amount of time which a [Test-taker](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) has left on a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test). This can be hidden if required.


If a time limit has been set for a test, the time a test-taker has left will be shown in the middle of the bar across the top of the screen once the test has been started.

Test-takers can choose to hide this if they wish, by clicking on the timer next to the time display.
