# Review Panel

>A Review Panel can be made available to [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker), in which they can see their progress through a particular [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).

When a test-taker moves to the first question of a test, the review panel, if activated by the [Test Author](../appendix/glossary.md#test-author), will automatically appear on the left. 

The review panel is divided into two parts: the first section shows information about the general *Test Status*, and the second section gives more detailed information on the different [Test-parts](../appendix/glossary.md#test-part). 


In *Test Status* the following general statistics are given about the test-taker's progress:

**Viewed:** In the *Viewed* box, test-takers can see how many screens form the test, and how many of them they have already viewed.  

**Answered:** Here, test-takers can see how many questions there are in the test, and how many they have answered.

**Unanswered:** Test-takers can see here how many of the questions in the test they have *not* answered

**Flagged:** The number of questions which have been flagged for later review will be shown in this box. See the section on [Accessibility Tools](../taking-a-test/accessibility-tools.md) for more information on flagging. 


In the second section, the test content for each Test-part is broken down by [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction), and organized into types, so that test-takers can see a more detailed overview of their progress. 

By selecting the corresponding icon at the top of the second section, test-takers can choose to display all interactions, only the interactions they have not yet answered, or only the interactions which have been flagged for review.
