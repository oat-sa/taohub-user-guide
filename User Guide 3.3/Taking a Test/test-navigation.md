# Test Navigation

>[Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) navigate through a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test) using the buttons which appear on the bottom right of the screen once they have begun the test.

There are five navigation buttons, which appear when applicable:

**Next:** By selecting the *Next* button, the test-taker will be taken to the next question in the test. The answer given to the question on the screen will be submitted for processing. You can also hit the letter *J* on your keyboard instead.

**Skip:** By selecting the *Skip* button, the test-taker will be taken to the next question in the test. Any answer given to the question on the screen will be disregarded, and therefore *not* submitted for processing.  

**Previous:** By selecting the *Previous* button, the test-taker will be taken back to the preceding question. You can also hit the letter *K* on your keyboard instead.

**End test:** This button appears on the last page of the test only, after the last question. It will take the test-taker back to the list of available tests.

**Skip and End test:** This button appears as the *skip* option when the last question is on the last page of the test.
