# Test Navigation

>[Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) navigate through a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test) using the buttons which appear on the bottom right of the screen once they have begun the test.

There are five navigation buttons, which appear when applicable:

**Next:** By selecting the *Next* button, the test-taker will be taken to the next question in the test. The answer given to the question on the screen will be submitted for processing.

**Skip:** By selecting the *Skip* button, the test-taker will be taken to the next question in the test. Any answer given to the question on the screen will be disregarded, and therefore *not* submitted for processing.  

**Previous:** By selecting the *Previous* button, the test-taker will be taken back to the preceding question. 

**End test:** This button appears on the last page of the test only, after the last question. It will take the test-taker back to the list of available tests.

**Skip and End test:** This button appears as the *skip* option when the last question is on the last page of the test.
