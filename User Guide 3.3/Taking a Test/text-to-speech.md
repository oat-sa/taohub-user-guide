# Text-to-Speech


>[Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) can elect to use the text-to-speech functionality for a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).

The text-to-speech functionality allows the test-taker to hear the test questions, or parts of them, read aloud.

*Note: This functionality is only available in the Premium Edition of TAO.*

To activate this functionality, test-takers need to carry out the steps below: 

Click on the headphones icon which appears at the bottom of the screen after beginning the test.

Four icons, representing four options, will appear:

**Hand over button:** By clicking on this and then on a specific question in the test, that question will be read aloud. The current word being read out will be highlighted.

**Play button:** The questions on the current page of the test will be read aloud. The current word being read out will be highlighted.

**Stop button:** The recording will be halted.

**Settings (interlocking cogs):** The speed of the speech the test-taker hears can be controlled here.
