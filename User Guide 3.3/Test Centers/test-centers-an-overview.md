# Test Centers: An Overview


>[Test Centers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-center) deliver the assessments assembled in TAO to [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker). They are typically institutions in the education sector.

*Note: The Test Center Manager comes as part of the Premium/Ignite Edition of TAO (or higher versions). If you are using the Community Edition you will need to install the extension taoTestCenter. See the [Extensions Manager](../management/extensions-manager.md) section of the User Guide for how to install this.* 


>This section provides an overview of the role test centers play in the TAO environment, as well as how to manage your test centers. 


**1.** The role of test centers

Test centers assign [Deliveries](../appendix/glossary.md#delivery) to [Groups](../appendix/glossary.md#group) of test-takers. Before a test center can assign a specific delivery to test-takers, the delivery first needs to be released to that test center. 


See the section [Licensing a Delivery to a Test Center](../test-centers/licensing-a-delivery-to-a-test-center.md) for details on this.

**2.** Managing test centers

Each test center needs to be registered in TAO. Typically, the [Tenant Administrator](../appendix/glossary.md#tenant-administrator) would set up the test center structure, and create the users with the appropriate roles.

For more information on how to add a test center, and which users and their associated roles are needed, see the section [Creating a new Test Center](../test-centers/creating-a-new-test-center.md). 

For information on how to remove an existing test center from your test center library, see [Removing a Test Center](../test-centers/removing-a-test-center.md).
