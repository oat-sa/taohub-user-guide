# Importing a Test

>Prepared [Tests](../appendix/glossary.md#test) can be taken from any computer and imported onto any other computer that also has access to TAO. This is done using an operation called *Import*.

**1.**  Click on the Tests icon on the [Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar).

This will take you to the Test [Library](../appendix/glossary.md#library), which you will see on the left.

**2.**  Click on the Test class (folder) in the library in which you wish to import the new test.

**3.**  Click on *Import* in the button bank below the library.

This opens a dialog box which asks you to select the format of the test to be imported. The supported input formats are: QTI (Question and Test Interoperability), RDF (Resource Description Framework) or CSV (Character-Separated Values).

**4.** Click the blue *Browse* button to find the file intended for import (alternatively, the file may be dragged and dropped into the box below the button).

**5.**  Once the Test is selected, click on the blue *Import* button.

This will import the Test into the Test library, for later use in [Deliveries](../deliveries/create-a-new-delivery.md).
