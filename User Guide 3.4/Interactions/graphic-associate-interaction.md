# Graphic Associate Interaction

>The Graphic Associate [Interaction](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction) gives [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) the opportunity to demonstrate their knowledge by depicting routes on a map or graphic in a prescribed way. This can be used for drawing out historical military marches, route-planning exercises, connecting the dots to form a missing piece of an image, etc. 

>This interaction is one of a series of [Graphic Interactions](../appendix/glossary.md#graphic-interactions) (the others are covered in their own sections). All graphic interactions can be found in the [Graphic Interactions Library](../appendix/glossary.md#graphic-interactions-library). 

[![Graphic Associate Interaction](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NoAT8065hyM/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtube.com/watch?v=NoAT8065hyM&rel=0 "Graphic Associate Interaction")

Once you have generated a new [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item), and clicked on *Authoring* in the [Action Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#action-bar), follow the steps below to create a new Graphic Associate Interaction:

**1.** From the Graphic Interactions library near the bottom of the *Interactions library* on the left, drag the *Associate* icon ![Graphic Associate](../resources/_icons/graphic-associate.png) onto the blank item and drop it onto the [Canvas](../appendix/glossary.md#canvas).

**2.** Choose the desired background graphic.

A [Resource Manager](../appendix/glossary.md#resource-manager) window will appear with which you can select a background graphic. You can re-use a background already in the resource manager, or you can upload a new one. To select one from the list of previously uploaded graphics, highlight the appropriate background graphic in the resource manager list and click the green *Select* button. To upload a new one, click on the blue *Add file(s)* button to browse the files on your computer, and then upload one to the resource manager by clicking the green *Upload* button.

Highlight the file you have chosen as your background by clicking on it, and it will appear on the right in the preview panel. Click *Select* in the bottom right of the window to continue.

A new authoring window will appear with the background graphic in the center of the canvas. Above the graphic there is a question field. On the left there is an [Associable Hotspot Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#associable-hotspot-panel) for inserting selected shapes that will represent *[Associable Hotspots](../appendix/glossary.md#associable-hotspots)* into the background graphic (these include four different shapes: rectangle, circle, ellipse, and polygon). Below the Hotspot Panel there is a trash can icon, which allows you to delete a poorly-placed or misshapen Hotspot. Below the background graphic is a gap match field for entering the answers (in the form of graphic elements).

**3.** Fill in the question field, where it says _define prompt_. 

This should cover such important information as what the background graphic represents, and what the Test-taker is supposed to do in this interaction.  

*Note: See the section on [Interaction Authoring Tools](../interactions/interaction-authoring-tools.md) for details on text editing options such as using italics or bold text in your item, and inserting features such as shared stimuli or media, tables or formulae.*

**4.** Insert the *Associable Hotspots* onto the background graphic.

To insert a rectangle, click on one corner and drag it across the intended area the Hotspot is supposed to cover. To insert a circle or ellipse, select its center and drag outward or inward until the Hotspot is the right size. To insert a polygon, begin at one corner, then click on each corner in succession until the Hotspot is complete. You can make all the shapes bigger or smaller (or in the case of polygons change the shape), but if necessary, click on the problem Hotspot, then click the trash can to delete it, and then try again.

After the Hotspots are inserted, set the number of Hotspot matches that the test-taker will be asked to provide (before he can continue to the next question), giving the minimum and the maximum. This can be done in the *Allowed number of matches* boxes in the [Interaction Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#interaction-properties-panel) on the right.

## Optional Extras when Creating a Task

The following options are available in the Interaction Properties panel on the right.

### Limiting the use of a choice

You can limit the number of times a particular element is used by clicking on it. When it appears in the *Identifier* box in the right-hand panel, set the *Allowed number of matches*. 

### Specifying the correct number of associations

You can specify the minimum and maximum number of associations that the test-taker will be asked to provide (before he can continue to the next question) in the *Number of Associations* boxes in the Interaction Properties panel. By default, these are empty, which means the test-taker can include as many (or as few) associations as he likes. (Setting the minimum to 0 allows the test-taker to skip the question.)

</aside>

**5.** Click *Response* on the right of the blue interaction header to select the associations between Hotspots (the answers).

By default, a test-taker receives one point per completely correct interaction, so in the case of Graphic Associate interactions, the test-taker has to select all the correct Hotspot pairs in order for the answer to be considered correct. Select the Hotspot pairs by clicking first on one Hotspot and then the associated Hotspot, until the pairs are all correctly connected by lines.

See Optional Extras below for other scoring methods.

## Optional Extras when Processing a Response

The following options are available in the [Response Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#response-properties-panel) on the right.

### Modifying the scoring method

You may want to modify the scoring method if, for example, you want the test-taker to receive partial credit for selecting some, but not all, of the correct Hotspot pairs. Or you may wish to give a higher weight to some of the Hotspot pairs than to others.

You can do this using the *map response* option of *Response processing*, in the Response Properties panel on the right. When you choose this option, there are several settings you need to enter. 

First, assign a weight for each Hotspot pair. In the Pair Scoring panel below the background graphic in your Interaction, select pairs of Associable Hotspots by clicking on *Add new pairs*, and then clicking on the blue *Add* button. Then assign a weight according to the value of the answer.

[Click here](../items/item-scoring-rules.md#item-scoring-rules) for more details on how to use this scoring method, and how to set the values of the other associated properties.

### Inserting modal feedback

If you wish, you can insert [Modal Feedback](../appendix/glossary.md#modal-feedback) into this Interaction. For more details on how to do this, see the [section on Modal Feedback](../items/modal-feedback.md).

**6.** Click the blue *Done* button. Your graphic associate interaction is now complete.

You can now preview your interaction using the steps given in the [Preview Instructions](../items/preview.md).
