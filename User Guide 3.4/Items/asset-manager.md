# Asset Manager


> The Asset Manager (formerly known as Asset Manager) provides a space to store assets (images, audio and video and passages) and to access them from any item. This is a universally shared folder, which means you don't need to keep uploading the same files for use in different items. The Assets folder will always appear as an option for choosing input when you are populating items.

You will find the same buttons in the Asset Manager as in most other functions under the library on the left (*New class*, *Delete*, *Import*, *Export*). The New class, Delete, and Export buttons work in a very similar way to most of the other functions. For more information on any of these, click on the following links: [New class](../appendix/glossary.md#class), [Delete](../appendix/glossary.md#delete), [Export](../appendix/glossary.md#export).

The *Import* button works in a slightly different way in the Asset Manager. Follow the steps below to import a new asset.

**1.**  Click on the _Asset_ icon in the *[Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar)*.

**2.** Click on the *Import* button in the button bank under the library on the left. This will bring up a dialog box in the center of the screen. 

**3.** Choose the input format. You have two choices - a file, or a passage. A passage, also known as shared stimulus, is a HTML fragment that can be shared between multiple items). A file can be in any picture, audio or video format (.jpg or .mp3, etc.) or a passage in .xml. 

**4.** When you have chosen the input format, you can either select *Browse* to browse the files your computer, or you can drag and drop the file into the space. 

**5.** When the file has uploaded, click on *Import*.

Once the file has been imported, you will see the message *Asset imported successfully*. The new file will appear in the library on the left, in the Asset folder. 

**6.**  Click on *Continue*.

A dialog box labeled _Edit instance_ will appear, with the details of the new asset. This contains the following information:

- *Label* (the name of your imported file)
- *Alternative Text* (rename the asset here if you wish)
- *Language* (the default language is English, but you can change the language of the asset if appropriate)

If you want to replace the file with another, click on *Upload new asset*. Click *Save* to save the changes, including alternative text.

## Creating or editing passages

To create a passage click on new passage and rename the label as needed. If you want to edit an existing passage select it on the tree. From here on the steps are the same.

**1.** By clicking on _Authoring_ you will enter the passage editor.

**2.** You can edit the text or add pictures and other media

**3.** You can see what the final passage will look like at any time by clicking on _Preview_

**4.** Once you are finished editing, save the passage and return to the asset manager.

Mind you that editing a passage will have an impact on every item that includes it.
