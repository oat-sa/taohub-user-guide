# Moving or copying items

>Items can be moved or copied within the same library

In any library in TAO you can move elements to a different folder by dragging and dropping them to the new destination. This not only applies to items but also to tests and test-takers, etc. You can copy elements by duplicating and moving them to a different folder. This is, however, limited to desktop environments.

The buttons *Copy To* and *Move To* allow you to do this in a different, platform-independent way. 

**1.**  Click on the *Copy To* ![Copy To](../resources/_icons/copy.png) or *Move To* ![Move To](../resources/_icons/move-item.png) icon in the button bank under the library.

The following dialog will appear:

![Copying an item](../resources/backend/items/copy-item.png)

**2.**  Select the new folder and click on *Copy* or *Move* at the bottom of the dialog depending on your original action.
