# APIP Text-to-Speech


>[Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) can elect to use the APIP text-to-speech functionality for a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test).

The APIP text-to-speech functionality allows the test-taker to hear the test questions, or parts of them, read aloud. It is only available to test-takers if pre-recorded audio files were integrated when the test was set up. 

When this functionality is enabled for a test, you will see a *Text to Speech* icon with a *Play* button on the right of each test item. 

**Play:** To listen to the audio, click on the *Play* button. 

The recorded audio will start playing, and the *Play* button will toggle to a *Pause* button. The relevant part of the text on the screen will be highlighted to synchronize with the recording.

**Pause:** You can pause and re-start the recording at any time by clicking on the *Pause* button, and then the *Play* button when you are ready to continue. 

It is also possible to highlight certain words or sentences to listen to within the text; if necessary multiple times.

By default, the recording plays from the beginning of the item, but you can toggle to *Start from here* mode by clicking on the icon to the right of the *Play* button (this contains an image of a small play button inserted into a text). In *Start from here* mode, you can click on any part of the text to begin the recording at that point, thus skipping other parts of the text.
