# Accessibility Tools

> The [Accessibility Tools](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker-tools) are a set of accommodation tools which are designed to aid the [Test-taker](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker) in various ways when taking tests. 


The Accessibility Tools which have been activated for a [Test](../appendix/glossary.md#test) can be found in the [Properties Panel](../appendix/glossary.md#properties-panel) on the right.

*Note: Accessibility tools can be activated either for a whole [Section](../appendix/glossary.md#section) of a test, or for each [Item](../appendix/glossary.md#item). Not all Accessibility Tools are activated for every test - this depends on the test configuration.*


The tools available are as follows:
 
## Calculator
This option provides the test-taker with a basic calculator.

## Answer Eliminator
The Answer Eliminator allows the test-taker to eliminate answers in *Choice* interactions. This is useful if there is a long list of answer choices, and the test-taker has a learning disability.

## Answer Masking
Answer Masking allows the test-taker to mask and unmask answers in choice interactions.

## Flag
Flagging an answer to a particular question allows the test-taker to review the answer at a later stage. Flagged items are marked in the review panel on the left. The test-taker can return to flagged items by clicking on the flag in the review panel.
