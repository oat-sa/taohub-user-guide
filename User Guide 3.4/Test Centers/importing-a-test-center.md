# Importing a Test Center

>[Test Center](../appendix/glossary.md#test-center) metadata files can be taken from any computer and imported onto any other computer which also has access to TAO. This is done using an operation called *Import*.

**Follow the steps below to import a test center:**

**1.**  Choose a location for your test center.

Click on *Test Centers* on the [Assessment Builder Bar](../appendix/glossary.md#assessment-builder-bar). This will take you to the [Test Center Library](../appendix/glossary.md#test-center-library), which you will see on the left.

Then click on the Test center class (folder) in the library in which you wish to import the new test center.

**2.** Import the selected test center.

Click on *Import* in the button bank below the library. This opens a dialog box. The supported format for the file to be imported is CSV (Comma-Separated Values). Field delimiters and field enclosers can be defined in the appropriate boxes. 

Next, click the blue *Browse* button to find the file intended for import (alternatively, the file may be dragged and dropped into the box below the button).

Once the file is selected, click on *Next*. This will take you to a new screen.

To import the chosen test center, click on the blue *Import* button. This will import the test center's profile into the Test Center library. The impoirted test Center can then deliver TAO assessments to [Test-takers](../appendix/glossary.md#test-taker.md).
