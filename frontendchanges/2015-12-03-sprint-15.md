- CSS SDK all new and shiny. This is for now on <http://gitlab.taocloud.org/|gitlab.taocloud.org/> because we are discussing the license model

---

- ui/bulkActionPopup: display a popup to let the user verify the list of resources that are going to be affected by a bulk action and optionally define a reason for that action. It contains also a cascading combobox to enable selecting categories/subcategories of reasons. 
Side note : the cascading combobox may be isolated in the future if need be.

- modal dialog component:
  + ui/dialog: display a modal dialog with a message and a list of buttons (each buttons trigger an event)
  + ui/dialog/alert: display a simple alert message, with a unique OK button
  + ui/dialog/confirm: display a simple confirm message, with a couple of buttons: ok, cancel

- polling component: executes an action every period of time, each scheduling is made once the previous one is completely done (uses promises). The polling can be paused/resumed, or the next scheduling forced to be ran immediately.

- datatable: the transform callbacks assigned to model definitions can now access to the dataset since the current row is provided as argument

- BrowserAppender
 - new tooltip (if merged)
