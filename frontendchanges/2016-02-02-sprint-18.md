`core/timer`

`performance.now` polyfill

`localForage` (offline storage)

Core :

 - `core/logger` provides now a logging API with different possible backends
 - You can use `performance.now()` as it is polyfilled (it also polyfills `Date.now()`)
 - `lib/localforage` is also there so you use it for your offline storages
 - `core/polling` let's you run actions periodically with a control on the flow
 - `core/timer` creates an accurate timer/countdown
 - `core/eventifier` supports now namespaces
 - `core/collections` gives you an access to ES6 collections (`Set`, `Map`, `WeakSet`, `WeakMap`)
 - `core/mimeType#getResourceType` will HEAD a resource to retrieve it's mime-type`

Components:

 - `ui/datalist` let's you create list of entries from a data source
 - `ui/dialog`, `ui/alert` and `ui/confirm` should always be used instead of window.alert, etc. _(reminder)_

`moment` updated and `momen-timezone` added
