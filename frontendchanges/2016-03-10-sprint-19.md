new test runner:
- added event in the QTI provider: `endsession`, called each time the client session is ended, either for server interruption (pause/terminate) or normal ending (timeout, end of test)
- added option in the delivery server to choose the extension/controller for the test runner service (default to taoQtiTest/Runner): `serviceExtension`, `serviceController` (config: `taoDelivery/testRunner`)

old test runner:
- added a way to extend the test context by loading a hook class (config: `taoQtiTest/testRunner`, option: `extraContextBuilder `, the class must be an instance of `\oat\taoQtiTest\models\TestContextBuilder`)

---

`ui/actionbar`: display a toolbar, with support for conditional buttons (standalone component extracted from the `datatable/datalist` components).

`taoClientDiagnostic/diagnostic`: the diagnostic tool is now standalone and can be integrated easily as a widget inside another view
