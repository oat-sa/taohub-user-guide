`taoClientDiagnostic/diagnostic`: the diagnostic tool is now standalone and can be integrated easily as a widget inside another view

`ui/actionbar`: display a toolbar, with support for conditional buttons (standalone component extracted from the `datatable/datalist` components).

---

new test runner:
- added event in the QTI provider: `endsession`, called each time the client session is ended, either for server interruption (pause/terminate) or normal ending (timeout, end of test)
- added option in the delivery server to choose the extension/controller for the test runner service (default to taoQtiTest/Runner): `serviceExtension`, `serviceController` (config: `taoDelivery/testRunner`)

old test runner:
- added a way to extend the test context by loading a hook class (config: `taoQtiTest/testRunner`, option: `extraContextBuilder `, the class must be an instance of `\oat\taoQtiTest\models\TestContextBuilder`)

---

`moment` updated and `moment-timezone` added

Core :

 - `core/logger` provides now a logging API with different possible backends
 - You can use `performance.now()` as it is polyfilled (it also polyfills `Date.now()`)
 - `lib/localforage` is also there so you use it for your offline storages
 - `core/polling` let's you run actions periodically with a control on the flow
 - `core/timer` creates an accurate timer/countdown
 - `core/eventifier` supports now namespaces
 - `core/collections` gives you an access to ES6 collections (`Set`, `Map`, `WeakSet`, `WeakMap`)
 - `core/mimeType#getResourceType` will HEAD a resource to retrieve it's mime-type`

Components:

 - `ui/datalist` let's you create list of entries from a data source
 - `ui/dialog`, `ui/alert` and `ui/confirm` should always be used instead of window.alert, etc. _(reminder)_
