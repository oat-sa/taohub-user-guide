`core/asyncProcess`: manage asynchronous process carrying deferred async steps. Only one process can run at a time per instance.

`eventifier` now supports multiple events: 
```
emitter.on('foo bar', handler);
```

adding `transform: translateZ(0);` on the loading bar to move the animation processing to the GPU when available, because the loading bar was eating up more and more CPU over the time.
