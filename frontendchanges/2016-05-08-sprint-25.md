Some components were here to bring the FileReader API using a Flash object. Since the supported browsers now have a good support of this API, these components are useless.
These obsolete components have been removed:
- `AsyncFileUpload`
- `polyfill/filereader`
- `polyfill/swfobject`
- `jquery.uploadify`

_Assets and Examples_ are now in a separate repo

Platform themes now also include tabs

CSS SDK: all projects that are using theming for either the platform or the items are now on gitlab.

`ui/autoscroll`: ensure that an element is visible inside its container. If the element is outside the viewport, scroll the container to make this element visible. The scroll is done using `animate`. The helper returns a promise that will always be resolved.

`ui/autoScroll`

`core/plugins` and `core/pluginLoader` have been challenged with the test runner and are now part of the core. It provides you a plugin system, suitable for dynamic additions to user interface. Plugins works by hooking an _host_ lifecycle.

`core/areaBroker` is a kind of hub to select areas from a user interface. It's now used in the new test runner and the coming version of the item creator
