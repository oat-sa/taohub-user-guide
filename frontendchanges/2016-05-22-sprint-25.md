Some components have been moved from the extension taoTests to taoCore:
`core/tokenHandler`: handles a security token in memory.
`core/providerRegistry`: manage a list of named providers. Each providers must implement at least the `init()` method.

New components added:
`core/delegator`: a helper that provide a way to apply « delegate » and « forward » patterns between an API and a provider
`core/communicator`: an API that wrap the logic around a bidirectional communication channel. It allows several implementations, like polling or websocket.

Note: a « provider » is the implementation of a particular API. The API offers several methods, each one is delegating to an implementation brought by a provider.
