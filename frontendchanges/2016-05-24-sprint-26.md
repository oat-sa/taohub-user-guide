In `core/plugin`: each plugin can implement a `install` method that will be called when the plugin will be bound to its host

In the new TestRunner, the proxy API exposes:
- `channel()` to register a listener on a particular communication channel (the listener will be called only if the communicator is enabled). The method returns the instance to chain.
- `send()` to send a message to the server using the communication channel, if enabled. The method returns a promise, that will be rejected if the send failed or the communicator is not enabled, and will be resolved when the message has been received and responded.
- `getCommunicator()` to access to the communication channel. The method returns a promise that will be resolved with the communicator instance if enabled (note: this method is provided only for special cases and is not intended to be use for normal communication)

The new Test Runner implements a bidirectional communication, that can be enabled through the config. For now, this implementation is based on a server polling behavior, and is not recommended to be used unless there is a strong need.

`core/plugin` has also 2 new methods `getContent` and `setContent` in order to share it's content state (to be able to restore it)
