`ui/hider`: the `toggle()` method now accept a second parameter to force the action (show or hide), like the jQuery method does.

`documentViewer/pdfViewer`: is now able to search inside the PDF, when the PDF.js lib is installed.
`documentViewer`: new options added
- `allowSearch`: allows to search within the document, each provider must implement the feature if relevant. (default to false)
- `caseSensitiveSearch`: Use a case sensitive search when the search feature is available (default to false)
- `highlightAllMatches`: Highlight all matches to see all of them at a glance (default to false)

`PDF.js`: since a license conflict does not allow to provide this library with the core extension, an install script is available here: <http://forge.taotesting.com/projects/tao/wiki/Install_PDFjs_viewer>

QTI Test Runner: a documentation has been added in the taoQtiTest extension wiki: <https://github.com/oat-sa/extension-tao-testqti/wiki/>
